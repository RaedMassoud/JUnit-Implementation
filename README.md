# JUnit-Implementation
This implementation covers JUnit 4 and JUnit 5.
During the process, I acquired valuable knowledge about the world of unit testing and the features provided by both versions of JUnit. This helped me gain a strong understanding of the fundamentals of unit testing. Furthermore, experimenting with test-driven development gave me a fresh perspective on writing code. I am eager to apply this new skill set in my upcoming project. I look forward to putting to use this new skill set in my next project
